/* 
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
The remainder is either 0 or 1
Example
```
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note:
 The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator.
 It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
